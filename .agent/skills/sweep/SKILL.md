description: Drain this repo's .agent/tasks/ queue autonomously and run-to-completion, taking EACH task to a ship-ready bar — claim a 00_todo/ task (`coop tasks claim`), build it, gate it green, self-review it against the .agent/rules KB and every hat, ITERATE until clean, COMMIT it on its own, then `coop tasks done` — without quitting early. Arms the Stop-hook sentinel. Use to "work all the tasks" / drain a backlog / run an unattended sweep.

# /sweep — drain the queue to a ship-ready bar, one commit per task

Run the work loop to completion with the Stop hook armed, so it can't quit while
work remains. Scope: this repo's `.agent/tasks/` (a task is a folder; its state is
its directory — `coop tasks` lists and moves them).

**Be agentic.** Each item is taken to a **ship-ready** bar: built, gated, then
*self-reviewed from every angle it touches and iterated until clean* — and only
**then** committed, on its own. The bar is not "it compiles"; it's "I'd defend
this in review from every hat **and it breaks no house rule.**" The house rules
are the spine: this repo's `AGENTS.md` and the worked examples in `.agent/rules/`.
Build *to* them, then *check the diff against them*.

## 1. Arm
- `touch .agent/active` — arms the Stop hook: until you remove it, trying to stop
  while any task remains in `00_todo/` is blocked. (It's git-ignored.)
- Read `AGENTS.md` in full (the gate **and** the contract), `.agent/tasks/README.md`,
  and every `.agent/rules/*.md` (the taste KB). Run `coop tasks` to announce the
  queue and the open `00_todo/` count.
- Optionally set a `/goal` to harden "don't stop early" on top of the sentinel.

## 2. The loop — claim the next task, repeat until 00_todo/ and 10_in_progress/ are empty
1. **Claim** — `coop tasks claim <id>` (moves `00_todo/` → `10_in_progress/`) *first*, so a
   parallel agent won't grab it. A task already in `10_in_progress/` is a prior attempt —
   resume it: read its `task.md`, then `git status`/`git diff`.
2. **Build** — wear the hats; obey `AGENTS.md`, match `.agent/rules/` and the
   surrounding style exactly. `/spec` first if it spans more than one file.
   `/verify-api` before calling anything you're not certain exists.
3. **Gate green** — the repo's exact gate (`AGENTS.md` → "The gate"). No green, no
   review, no commit.
4. **Self-review the diff** from every angle it touches — correctness, security /
   abuse path, UX, tests (including the failure path), docs, readability — against
   the house rules. Fix what you find; iterate until you'd defend it.
5. **Commit** — one focused commit for this task. Append a one-line *what + why* to
   `.agent/LOG.md`.
6. **Done** — `coop tasks done <id>` (moves it to `xx_done/`; the move ships in the
   commit). Blocked instead? `coop tasks block <id>` and fill in its `decision.md`
   (the question · options · recommendation), then move on.
7. Spot unrelated work? Drop it in `.agent/BACKLOG.md` and return to the queue —
   don't derail the current task.

## 3. Finish
- When `00_todo/` and `10_in_progress/` are empty, `rm -f .agent/active` to disarm, then run
  a completeness pass: re-check every task you moved to `xx_done/` against `git log` —
  gate green *and* a commit exists. Reopen anything that doesn't hold up with
  `coop tasks claim <id>` (back to `10_in_progress/`), and go again.
- Report: tasks shipped, anything parked in `BACKLOG.md` or `50_blocked/`, gate status.
